# Workday Scheduler - using JS

## Description

This was my 5th assignment from the GT Bootcamp. The HTML and CSS files came with starter code, but there was no JS or functionality to the webpage. Below is a list of the requirements/problems I had to tackle:

* Display the current day at the top of the page
* Ensure the hour blocks are color coded correctly (past, present, or future), and dynamically update in real time
* Ensure the user's input in the text area can be saved by clicking the button on the side of that block, and save the input into local storage

## Resources
I used Day.js to access local time. This is how I was able to display the date at the top of the page, and ensure the timeblocks update, live.
